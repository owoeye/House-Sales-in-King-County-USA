# Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict **housing prices** based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more. The analysis is performed using **Jupyter Notebook** and **Python (pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn)**.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **visualizations**
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables)
- **Linear Regression Model** for price prediction
- Model evaluation using **RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing-price-prediction.git
cd housing-price-prediction
```

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Run `Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb` step by step.
